Q1: What are the data type and the range of the data types 
    if you try to import a PNG file using matplotlib? 
    How about with a JPG image?

A1: 
    JPG image data type: uint8
    JPG image range: 0 - 255
    PNG image data type: float32 
    PNG image range: 0 - 1

    how did you convert that?
